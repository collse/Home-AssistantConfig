Home Assistant quick install via A-in-One-Installer

1) Download RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

2) Follow the Raspian installation guide: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

3) Once you have installed Raspian and your Raspberry Pi is at its login screen, login with the following credentials:

User: pi
password: raspberry

4) Change the default password for user ‘pi’

5) # passwd

6) Now - fully update the raspberry pi

# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade

7) after this has completed use the AIO installer, follow the install here https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/raspberry-pi-all-in-one/

8) The process can take a while but once your Raspberry Pi reboots (roughly after 30minutes) it will start and Home Assistant will start at reboot but will be compiling additional components (zwave etc - dont worry) - this can take some time up to 20 minutes or more

9) Once this has completed and you can access the Home Assistant web interface connect to your Pi via SSH using the user: pi / your_password

10) change to your homeasistant user:
# sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant

11) change to the homeassistant environment
# source /srv/homeassistant/homeassistant_venv/bin/activate

12) now upgrade all pip components:
# pip3 freeze --local | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U

13) when this process completes reboot your pi

# exit
pi@# sudo shutdown -r now

Done - when you pi has restarted you are all updated and good to go
